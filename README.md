Charity Funding Predictor

The goal of this project is to configure a tool that can help the nonprofit foundation select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. 
Using my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks I have created a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
The data source represents a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.
